1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,280

2
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,960
JOSE ANDRES: One more with gelatin, one more with gelatin

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,150
using the animal base.

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,640
Everyone knows how to use.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,572
Do you like strawberries?

6
00:00:10,572 --> 00:00:11,910
STUDENTS: Yeah.

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,610
JOSE ANDRES: We are not in season, I know.

8
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,300
But this is a video, so forgive me.

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,680
So let's go with a strawberry.

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,760

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,460
A strawberry, just in case you didn't understand me.

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,583
So I think I'm going to stop it.

13
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,690

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,800
What you're going to see here is something very important.

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,780
At the very beginning, it said strawberry, but we didn't see any

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,340
strawberries yet.

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,590
Don't worry, patience.

18
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,690

19
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,680
They are coming.

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,090
[LAUGHTER]

21
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,500
JOSE ANDRES: What you are going to see is one technique that, thanks to

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:12,470
gelatin, has given chefs the opportunity to make a mousse-like

23
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:19,580
product without the use of heavy cream or fat.

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,350
And why is this amazing?

25
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:31,480
If go to some of the popular coffee places in the world, and you order

26
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,640
your mocha with whipped cream--

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,870
it comes with whipped cream, anyway--

28
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,310
you'll see that machine, right?

29
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,010
The whipped cream canister, the whipped cream bottle that used N2O,

30
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,940
nitrous oxide?

31
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:57,810
So we are able to put heavy cream, put the nitrous oxide, and then we shake.

32
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,290
We turn down, we press, and we have whipped cream.

33
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,330
Great.

34
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,300
I don't have to break my arm anymore again in my life.

35
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:06,970
This is powerful.

36
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,509
But let's you are making a strawberry mousse.

37
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,370
And let's say you put a traditional strawberry mousse.

38
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,070
Will be 50% strawberries, right?

39
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,480
Yes?

40
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,270
Will be 40% cream, yes?

41
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,460
10% sugar?

42
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,860
You will blend everything.

43
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,220
In the traditional, you will whip the whipped cream.

44
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,370
You'll mix some gelatin with the strawberry.

45
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,260
You'll wait until the strawberry gets kind of gel-y.

46
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,100
And then you'll start mixing slowly the whipped cream with the strawberry.

47
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,590
And at the end, you will let it rest.

48
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,950
And you will have a strawberry mousse.

49
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,690
Yummy, right?

50
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:52,640
But that has a fundamental problem, that the mousse is only 50%

51
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,890
strawberry.

52
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,290

53
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,190
You may say, I like heavy cream.

54
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,950

55
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,530
All right, so that's your problem.

56
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,410
[LAUGHTER]

57
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,860
JOSE ANDRES: But imagine for a second, if 50% of strawberry mousse is

58
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:18,500
delicious, imagine 100% is strawberry mousse.

59
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,300
Do you ask this strawberry if she wants to be mixed with the fat?

60
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,400

61
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,570
You didn't, right?

62
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,280
But we do it.

63
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,970
Why?

64
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:36,780
What you're about to see gives you the power to make 100% strawberry mousse

65
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,770
without ever using fats anymore, only with the power of gelatins.

66
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,710
Because gelatins are almost the same as fat and whipped cream.

67
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:51,290
It gives you the opportunity to retain the air that comes inside the liquid.

68
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,760
By retaining a lot of air, you are able to make these amazing mousses.

69
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,810
So I told you that, but now forget about what I told you.

70
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:08,300
Because this strawberry mousse has some heavy cream, only because we are

71
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,820
going to be using liquid nitrogen.

72
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,240
And with liquid nitrogen, a strawberry doesn't behave anymore.

73
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,350
They need the heavy cream.

74
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,640
But important what I told you.

75
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,450
This is a new way, what you're going to see, of making 100% pure mousses of

76
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,070
liquids that are not fats.

77
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,850
Breakthrough in civilization.

78
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,890
No, this is not a laugh.

79
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,140
It's serious.

80
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,290

81
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,430
So here we add the heavy cream.

82
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,310
Here we put a little bit of syrup.

83
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,650
Here we have gelatin.

84
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,100
The gelatin you always need to rehydrate it first.

85
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,400
It's very stiff.

86
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,820
They need like a bath to loose down the gelatin.

87
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,910
It's a very stiff person.

88
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,560
So you always put it in water first.

89
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,120
And so we're going to put the gelatin and the syrup with the cream.

90
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,900
And then we're going to add this beautiful strawberry puree.

91
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,430
All right?

92
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,200
You mix the whole thing.

93
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,840
You're going to strain to make sure there's no gelatin lumps anywhere,

94
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,420
pure, beautiful, tasty, sweet, delicious.

95
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,970
And we put it in the canister.

96
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,620

97
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,660
And then we put the nitrous oxide.

98
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,840
We make sure that gets to the right temperature.

99
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,910
And take a look what we do.

100
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:36,170
This, what you see there, is a strawberry powder, dry strawberries

101
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,140
that we make like a flour of dry strawberries.

102
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,060
And we make the mousse of the strawberries.

103
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,325
We cover it with more of the powder of dried strawberries.

104
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:48,140
And we are going to introduce these in the liquid nitrogen,

105
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,870
only for a few seconds.

106
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,560
What's happening right now, the outside is frozen,

107
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,740
the inside is creamy.

108
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,590
When we cut through, the inside is pure creaminess.

109
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,440
The outside is pure hard shell.

110
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,220
Ladies and gentlemen, a strawberry.

111
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,737
[APPLAUSE]
